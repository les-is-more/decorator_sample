    "There are two broad classes of missing data: data missing at random, and data missing not at random. When considering what to do with our data we must keep this in mind. I won't go into detail here because I wrote an entire blog post on this subject once upon a time, which is worthwhile reading on the subject:  http://www.residentmar.io/2016/06/12/null-and-missing-data-python.html. The typology of the missing data strongly informs how best to approach dealing with it; or rather it's safer to say that if the data is missing not completely at random, you are going to need domain expertise to understand what to do with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the data are truly NMAR, then the missing data mechanism must be modeled as part of the estimation process in order to produce unbiased parameter estimates. That means that, if there is missing data on Y, one must specify how the probability that Y is missing depends on Y and on other variables. This is not straightforward because there are an infinite number of different models that one could specify. Nothing in the data will indicate which of these models is correct. And, unfortunately,\n",

    "> For some kinds of data you will run into the problem of having many samples, but not having labels for all of those samples, only for a subset of them. This situation occurs particularly often in research contexts, where it's often easy to get a small number of labelled data points, via hand-labelling, but significantly harder to gather the full dataset, if the full dataset is sufficiently large.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This is known as the **semi-supervised learning problem**. It is semi-supervised because it lies in between unsupervised learning, which does not use labels, and supervised learning, which requires them. In a semi-supervised learning problem you don't have all the labels or none of them, only some of them.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Semi-supervised learning is a restatement of the missing data imputation problem which is specific to the small-sample, missing-label case. This problem gets its own name likely because it is so commonly encountered in research and dataset generation contexts. It's a useful tool to know about more generally for missing data imputation from a limited sample size, but the algorithms have poor performance characteristics for larger samples. In those cases, perhaps try applying machine learning to the problem directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about semi-supervised learning, check out the notebook [\"Notes on semi-supervised learning\"](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/notes-on-semi-supervised-learning/). The TLDR is that these techniques are an approach that works well when the number of labeled is extremely small, but do not scale to larger data because they involve building a similarity matrix, an $O(n^2)$ operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maximum likelihood imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple approaches are easy to implement, but can lead to high bias. The model imputation approach is a bit more challenging, but it's still off-the-shelf, and it does still have a problem with introducing bias into the dataset. In fact, [this paper](http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/MissingDataByML.pdf) on the subject goes so far as to say that really you _ought_ to be using either of two specialized techniques: maximum likelihood, or multiple imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics the **maximum likelihood estimator** is any statistical estimator for a distribution of interest which has the property that it maximizes the \"likelihood function\" of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a statistical estimator takes a random sample of data and attempts to explain something about the overall distribution by generalizing from that sample. For example, $\\frac{\\sum(y)}{\\text{len}(y)}$ is an estimator for the average of a set of data $y$. It is MLE because it doesn't have any bias: it converges on the true mean of the distribution (given a large enough number of samples). For most problems an MLE estimator is the simplest estimator to build. But sometimes an MLE estimator is not possible, and in other cases some amount of bias in the estimator is useful (if you know something the model doesn't; see e.g. regularization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum likelihood imputation is maximum likelihood estimation applied to missing data. First, build a maximum likelihood estimator with the complete records in the dataset as your predictor variables and the variable containing missing values your target. Then, for each record containing missing data, draw a value from the distribution you generated, one parameterized with the known dependent values of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This purely statistical approach to this problem has the drawback of statistical models more generally in that it is dependent on the probability distribution you use in your estimator. If you expect the data is normally distributed, you may fit a normal distribution to the data. If it's Bernoulli you can fit a Bernoulli distribution. If it's a combination of different distributions, then you have to build a multimodal distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason there is no \"standard\" maximum likelihood estimator imputation technique. Instead, qouting from [this excellent CrossValidated answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/51006/full-information-maximum-likelihood-for-missing-data-in-r):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Handling missing data with Maximum Likelihood on all available data (so-called FIML) is a very useful technique. However, there are a number of complications that make it challenging to implement in a general way.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Consider a simple linear regression model, predicting some continuous outcome from say age, sex, and occupation type. In OLS, you do not worry about the distribution of age, sex, and occupation, only the outcome. Typically for categorical predictors, they are dummy coded (0/1). To use ML, distributional assumptions are required for all variables with missingness. By far the easiest approach is multivariate normal (MVN). This is what for example Mplus will do by default if you do not go out for your way to declare the type of variable (e.g., categorical).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In the simple example I gave, you would probably want to assume, normal for age, Bernoulli for sex, and multinomal for job type. The latter is tricky because what you actually have are several binary variables, but you do not want to treat them as Bernoulli. This means you do not want to work with the dummy coded variables, you need to work with the actual categorical variable so the ML estimators can properly use a multinomial, but this in turn means that the dummy coding process needs to be built into the model, not the data. Again complicating life.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Further, the joint distribution of continuous and categorical variables is nontrivial to compute (when I run into problems like this in Mplus, it pretty quickly starts to break down and struggle). Finally, you really ideally specify the missing data mechanism. In SEM style, FIML, all variables are essentially conditioned on all others, but this is not necessarily correct.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For example, perhaps age is missing as a function not of gender and occupation type, but their interaction. The interaction may not be important for the focal outcome, but if it is important for missingness on age, then it must also be in the model, not necessarily the substantive model of interest but the missing data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know of any off-the-shelf maximum likelihood imputation algorithms in Python, for precisely this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most flexible possible solution for modeling the distribution of data is kernel density estimation. `sklearn` includes [raw kernel density estimator algorithms](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/density.html) available. I might suggest starting there. Otherwise, if you want to go the statistical estimator route, the `statsmodel` package includes facilities for working with all of the most common types of statistical distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the techniques discussed so far are what one might call \"single imputation\": each value in the dataset is filled in exactly once. In general, the limitation with single imputation is that because these techniques find maximally likely values, they do not generate entries which accurately reflect the distribution of the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the extreme case of replacing missing values in the data with the mean value, for example. If we had been able to observe the data we were missing, we would naturally expect to see some variability in it: extreme values, outliers, and records which do not completely fit the \"pattern\" of the data. This noise is intrinsic to the dataset, yet mean value replacement makes no attempt to represent it in its result. This leads to bias in any downstream models, which are exposed to a trend (the presence of the mean value in the datset) which does not exist in the underlying data. This in turn decreases accuracy during both the train and test phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the statistical literature, arguably the most advanced methodology for performing missing data imputation is **multiple imputation**. In multiple imputation we generate missing values from the dataset many times. The individual datasets are then pooled together into the final imputed dataset, with the values chosen to replace the missing data being drawn from the combined results in some way. In other words, multiple imputation breaks imputation out into three steps: imputation (multiple times), analysis (staging how the results should be combined), and pooling (integrating the results into the final imputed matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any technique that follows this general framework is a multiple imputation technique. As such, there are a variety of multiple imputation algorithms and implementations available. The most popular algorithm is called MICE, and a Python implementation thereof is available as part of the `fancyimpute` package: https://github.com/iskandr/fancyimpute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A simple imputation, such as imputing the mean, is performed for every missing value in the dataset. These mean imputations can be thought of as “place holders.”\n",
    "\n",

    "3. The observed values from the variable “var” in Step 2 are regressed on the other variables in the imputation model, which may or may not consist of all of the variables in the dataset. In other words, “var” is the dependent variable in a regression model and all the other variables are independent variables in the regression model.\n",

The cycling through each of the variables constitutes one iteration or “cycle.” At the end of one cycle all of the missing values have been replaced with predictions from regressions that reflect the relationships observed in the data.\n",

    "6. Steps 2 through 4 are repeated for a number of cycles, with the imputations being updated at each cycle. At the end of these cycles the final imputations are retained, resulting in one imputed dataset. Generally, ten cycles are performed; however, research is needed to identify the optimal number of cycles when imputing data under different conditions. The idea is that by the end of the cycles the distribution of the parameters governing the imputations (e.g., the coefficients in the regression models) should have converged in the sense of becoming stable.\n",
